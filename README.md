# Interactive Generator Demonstration
## Overview
This is a personal thought experiment to fully exercise understanding of various facets of (Java/Type)Script generators
* two-way communication
* effect on coding style when treating the generator as a program communicating with a host environment.

The project consists of 
* a Generator IO API designed to execute generators-as-programs where the program effects the world (output) by yielding Commands and receives Input from the world (host environment).
* a number of programs written in this style
  * Amb - Generator as program delegating to generator as lazy stream. 
  * Gravity Tiles -
